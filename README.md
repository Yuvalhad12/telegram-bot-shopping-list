# telegram-bot-shopping-list
that telegram bot lets you add, remove, delete items from your shopping list.
changes are presistent and saved to a json file which consists a list of all items in the list.

SYNTAX:
--
* DELETE ALL - deletes list.
* DELETE *item* - deletes *item* from list. If no item was provided \ the item isn't in the list, the last item will be removed.

--

if no syntax was provided, the message would be automatically appended to the list.
NOTICE: the bot would display the list everytime it's changed, and that's why there's no DISPLAY syntax or something like that.


The script is highly customizable tho, so if you want to modify it - I am sure it will be easy.
